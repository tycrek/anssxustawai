::: warning ass 0.15.0 is experimental
Branch [`dev/0.15.0`](https://github.com/tycrek/ass/tree/dev/0.15.0/) is a full rewrite of the ass codebase.

At this time, it is working and ready for testing, **but is very incomplete** and is lacking many features currently found in ass 0.14.

**The existing configs, data.json, and auth.json will be abandoned. There is currently no migration nor one planned.**
